<h1>👨‍💻 Selenium Test Automation Framework Project Summary</h1>

This project is a Java Selenium Test Automation Framework built to validate workflows on QA Brains Practice Site
. It demonstrates expertise in:

1. End-to-end UI test automation
2. Handling dynamic elements (dropdowns, radio buttons, checkboxes)
3. Authentication and form submission testing
4. Cart and feedback flow validation
5. Framework design following best practices (Page Object Model + reusable utilities)

🛠 Tools & Technologies

Programming Language: Java (8)

Automation Framework: Selenium WebDriver

Testing Framework: TestNG

Build Tool: Maven

Design Pattern: Page Object Model (POM)

IDE Used: IntelliJ IDEA

Browser: Chrome (via ChromeDriver)

📂 Framework Highlights

✅ Page Object Model (POM): Promotes maintainability and reusability

✅ Explicit Waits & JavaScript Executor: Ensures stable interaction with dynamic elements

✅ Reusable Utility Methods: Simplifies writing scalable test cases

✅ Cross-Browser Ready: Can be extended for multiple browser support

✅ Modular Test Classes: Organized structure for better readability

🚀 Getting Started

1️⃣ Prerequisites

Install Java JDK 8 or higher

Install Maven

Install IntelliJ IDEA

Configure ChromeDriver

2️⃣ Clone the Repository

git clone https://github.com/ShihabSaif/Audacity_assignment.git

cd Audacity_Automation_Assignment

3️⃣ Install Dependencies

mvn clean install

4️⃣ Run Tests

Go to the desired test class & run it.

🔮 Future Enhancements
1. Need to bring all test cases in a working testng.xml file so that all test cases can be run in one go instead of seperate run like now.
2. Integration with Allure Reports or TestNG HTML Reports
3. Data-driven testing using Excel/CSV/JSON
4. Integration with CI/CD pipelines (Jenkins / GitHub Actions)

👔 Professional Value

This project highlights my ability to:

1. Build automation frameworks from scratch

2. Apply best practices in test automation

3. Solve real-world QA challenges (element handling, waits, dynamic content)

4. Deliver scalable and maintainable test suites
